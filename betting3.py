#fix the outBet method and make a custom one for each round (we are doing outbetting prevention instead of side pot bc its only two player)
##small blind big blind stuff (dont append)

## game ends when a player has no chips, must match bets (meeting bet, checking, folding, raising etc also must be added) 
#do a do while loop for if the second person's (not necessarily player 2 bc of small blind) bet is less than the other players, they must do a higher
#for raising, if someone raises, must run a check that the other person's bet now must also match this
## flding must be added (they select this, their bet is set to 0 for that round and round ends) (make a fold method)
#game ends if someone runs out of chips (if chips = 0, then exit program and run the end game method) (make an end game method)
#checking => both bets are set to zero, and since they equal, the program continues without issue
#for whose turn it is to start first, use the %2 thing to determine small blind

#make separate methods for player 1 and 2 for flop etc
#to toChip ratio
#round the decimals for the list
#testing
# WHY DOESNT THE SECOND OVERBETTING FOR FLOOD NOT WORK?
