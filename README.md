## Description
This project is for Hello World Hackathon 2023 at Purdue University. The program runs poker game with two players. While two players play the game, the program collects playing data. The data is used to train deep learning model that predicts player's hand from their actions during poker game. This model can be used to as a part of AI poker bot in the future work. This was created using java, and python.
